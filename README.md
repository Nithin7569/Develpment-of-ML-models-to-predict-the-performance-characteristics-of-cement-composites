# Cement Composites Performance Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the performance characteristics of cement composites using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as Blaine measurement, soundness, LOI, insoluble residue, and SO3 content. These inputs are mapped to outputs like initial and final settling times, as well as compressive strength at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days.

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- ANN
- DNN

*Best Model: KNN with an R-squared value of **0.8799*.

## Objective
To accurately forecast cement composite properties to improve material design and performance.
